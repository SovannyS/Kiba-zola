<p> Here at Kiba &amp; Zola Bully boards you will find an array of healthy dog treats. One of my dogs <strong>Kiba</strong> had been dealing with very severe allergic reactions since he was a puppy. 
With swollen eyes, blistering paws and skin infections! Being very limited for any exciting treats and food we needed a change. 
After finding the right medication and diet, it was decided to find single-minimal ingredient, preservative free, allergy friendly treats. 
All treats on your board are made from trusted local and small businesses with intention for your fur baby! </p> <img src="file:/C:users/household/desktop/wetnose.png" "height=300px" "width=500px" "alt=Kiba and treat">
